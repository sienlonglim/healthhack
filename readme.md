This project was created for Health Hack Hackathon 2024. It is about creating a conversational assistant for explaining medical reports in medical education. The solution is to build a Conversational Assistant, such that after a patientâ€™s initial consultation with the doctor, one can access the tool to self-help on questions about the medical report. This acts as a second layer of FAQ after healthcare professions. The solution utilizes GPT4-preview and OpenAI's embedding model to build a Conversational Retrieval Augmented Generation App. The underlying LLM will refuse to diagnose patient or give out of context answers, lowering the chances of hallucinations.
